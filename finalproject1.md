# Outline
I've dedicated my final project to examining the pivotal role of exercise and proper nutrition in combatting obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. This subject resonates deeply with me because I am passionate about fostering longevity and well-being in all individuals. We find ourselves in a unique era where technological advancements have made our lives less physically demanding, contributing to a widespread lack of activity among a significant portion of the population. Additionally, the convience of fast food has fundamentally altered dietary habits in the United States, depriving many of essential nutrients and fostering unhealthy eating patterns.

Through this project, my aim is to emphasize the importance of these issues, arming people with knowledge to make informed decisions for happier, healthier lives. I intend not only to highlight the alarming statistics regarding the sedentary lifestyle prevalent in America but also showcase the percentage of individuals who have embraced health-conscious living. Rather than instilling fear, my goal is to educate and inspire. I want to demonstrate that adopting healthier habits is not an impossible challenge but a rewarding investment in long-term well-being.

My call to action will offer a plethora of resources, empowering individuals to take control of their lifestyles with practical and free tools. I'll provide actionable insights into effective exercise regimens and offer guidance on nutritious diets and food choices that can easily be incorporated into daily routines. Most importantly, I want to emphasize that we are all human and prone to imperfection. My intention is not to induce guilt but to encourage self-reflection and inspire positive change.

# Project Structure
> Setup: Lack of exercise and poor nutrition has led to the rise of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. I want to show the audience the break down of these statistics by age group. The age group I want to focus on is 18-65+. This will consist of explanations that are in the topic. I will break down each part of it by showing what proper nutrition, exercise guidelines, obesity rates, heart disease rates, and diabetes rates from the data gathered by the CDC.
> Conflict: The lifestyles that are generally common and the availability of food sources that are not nutritionally opitimal are major contributing factors to these issues. The currewnt careers and lifestyles choices that are more accessible are not exactly the best for you.
> Resolution: The audience is going to be led to the fact that this decision comes from within oneself and that they have to have the discipline to pursue a healthy life. I will provide them with the basic tools to start that journey and hope to inspire them to achieve this.
