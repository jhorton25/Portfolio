# Wireframes / storyboards
I did my wireframes and storyboard directly on shorthand. I found shorthand awesome becausew it helped me generate the flow of how I wanted my story to flow. I definitely had to step back and recalibrate how I was going to do this based on the feedback from part one of final project. I really enjoyed talking with everyone and also coming to the terms that I took on a very broad topic and needed to be more specific. I decided to change my direction of my project and focus on why adults should encorporate exercise into their lives. I don't want to scare people into this journey, but rather be a beacon of hope. I want to share my story and how physical fitness changed my life.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My target audience is quite broad, but I honestly want it that way. I wanted to focus on adults and emphasize that it is never too late to implement a healthier lifestyle. The people I shared this with for the interview range in age from their mid 20s to low 50s. I hope to reach people who are looking for some extra courage or inspiration to start exercising. I hope they can also spread the word and help others that need to hear this message. I want to be inclusive and show that anyone is capable of pursuing a healthier life. 

## Interview script

| Goal                | Questions to Ask                            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Impact              | What is the story?                          |
| Is it fluid?        | What did you like? What didn't you like?    |
| Is it applicable?   | Does this apply to you or anyone you know?  |
| Quality             | Do you have recommendations for improvement?|

I kept the questions simple. My story isn't a complex one, but one that gets to the point. I wanted the audience to put into what they got out of it. I know everyone perceives and digest information in different ways which was something I definitely needed to consider when choosing these questions. In my opinion the more simple it is, the better. I know that may turn people away, but my goal has always been to be clear, concise, and easy to understand when presenting information to an audience.
