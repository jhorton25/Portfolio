# The final data story
[Here is my final story!](https://preview.shorthand.com/2mLMgLoyeHflZMzt)

# Changes made since Part II
I made some really big changes since part II and it's been a lot of work. I wouldn't change a dang thing though because I learned a lot during this final part of the project. Based on the feedback from part II I knew I needed to add some more data visiualizations and an infographic. Adding both of these aspects I had to redsesign how I was going to tie all of this together to tell a story. 

The additional data I added was to support the audience in identifying where America is currently at with physical activity, overweight classification, and obesity. I really hope my visualization caught the attention of the audience and made them realize that this is alarming. In presenting them that information I wanted to then show the audience what exercise can do based on those indicators of inactivity, overweight classification, and obesity. A huge feedback point I received was arranging everything to facilitate a smooth story telling experience. 

Finally, one last thing I added was an infographic containing additional details promoting the positive mental health benefits of exercise. This was another feedback topic and I saw an opportunity to step outside of my comfort zone and create something I found really cool! I had never made an infographic and it was challenging at first, but I believe I was able to deliver the right amount of information without overstimulating the audience. I used Canva to create the graphic which and I enjoyed learning a new software. My goal was to continue with a simple presentation for the audience to experience.  

## The audience
The audience I identified was all adults 18-65+. I know that's very broad, but this is definitely a topic that can play a huge part in anyone's life. I wanted to be inclusive and show that this lifestyle has something for everyone! That's the true beauty of exercise, there is something for everyone. A portion of my feedback said that I should look at a smaller group, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I believe I did the right thing by including all adults and it helped me tell a better story. 

## Final design decisions
When it came to final decision design I didn't expect choosing a palette would be so challenging. I decided to use darker tones and a more modern feel. I did this because it's a serious topic, but I did include small bits of colors in images to catch the attention of the audience and also use it to emphasize the positive topics. Arranging the data and visualizations was crucial in telling the right story and I believe I executed that well. Overall, seeing this come to together from part I to part III was really rewarding.

# Final thoughts
I really did enjoy this project. I didn't know I would have it in me to design a good product and I built some much needed confidence in myself through this whole process. In the beginning, I was very stressed about this and was quite lost, but the exercises and assignments along the way helped build me up. It was all very demanding and that's how it should be. This wasn't easy and I appreciated the challenge because at the end it truly made me better. This project allowed me to take constructive feedback and apply in positive ways. It was awesome working with such a diverse group of students coming from so many different backgrounds.
