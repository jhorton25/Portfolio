# About me
Hi! My name is Jake Horton and I'm currently a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm in my second semester of the MISM BIDA track! I obtained my undergraduate degree from Missouri University of Science and Technology in Infomation Science and Technology(IST). I have always described the degree as a crossroad between technology and business. I graduated in May 2019 and commissioned a day after graduation as an MI Officer in the Army. I am currently a Captain and have been on active duty for over four years. I was selected for the Artificial Intelligence Scholars Program that is offered through the Army and that's how I ended up here at CMU. Upon completion of school I'll be assisting the Army's effort to harness and implement AI across our organization. I'm extremely grateful to be here and I hope to truly make a difference in this world utilizing technology.
