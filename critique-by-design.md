# Critique By Design
For the critique by design project I decided to build a new visualization based on, ["Ranked: Top 10 Countries by Military Spending"](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-top-10-countries-by-military-spending/). I found this assignment quite challenging because I found that this visualization was already very well made. A big reason why I chose this visualization is due to my background but also acknowledging that there are many great visualizations out there. I wanted to take this visualization and simplify it. It may not be as glamorous but I've learned it's not always making it jaw dropping gorgeous. In many cases simplicity is this best way to tell a story. I also wanted to acknowledge magnitude and proportions in the new design. I feel like more often than not, most folks will hear a number and see some comparisons which leads them to somewhat of biased opinion. The new visualization that I designed helps aleviate that and allows the audience to see a bigger picture.  

# Critique 
Overall, I thought this visualization was great. The author really designed something that is memorable, simple, and tells a story. One positive aspect that stood out to me was the use of color. I believe the author kept it simple yet impactful with the gradients used. One negative aspect was the size of the visualization. In order to see the whole visualization I found myself scrolling down the page and I don’t prefer that. I would much rather see it all in front of me rather than scrolling down because it makes me feel like I’m missing something. I also want to note that I do appreciate the notes at the bottom of the visualization giving highlights on certain countries. These highlights could be used to connect dots to other current events happening in the world.   
I’m going to expand on what worked really well in this visualization. The author stuck to a colorway and utilized gradients to correlate to the value that country spent on military spending. The darker the gradient the larger the value which is very straightforward and easy to understand. I really do appreciate the creativity that went into this visualization. The title grabs your attention and the chart that was used is a hybrid between a pie chart and tree map. The information on it isn’t chaotic or overwhelming which allows this visualization to flow nicely. 
Now unto the aspects that didn’t work well in this visualization. Though I do appreciate the color that is used, some of the countries are hard to see like Saudi Arabia, India, S. Korea, and Japan. I also believe that the utilization of green Army figures is distracting and taking away the seriousness of this visualization. I understand how the color and choice of the figures do compliment it in a sense, but I do believe it does more harm than good. 

# Design 
The biggest challenge for me was trying to figure out how I was going to breakdown this visualization and rebuild it in such a way that can tell a story. I wanted to show three different statitics but I had no idea how I was going to piece it together to make it look half way decent. I finally decided on combining these three visualizations to tell the story I wanted. When I put them all together I asked a couple people on their thoughts about the visualizations. The questions I asked were: 
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  
Overall, their responses were what I was hoping for. They were able to tell right away what the visualizations was trying to tell them. One of the people I interviewed had a little bit stronger opinions about it due to their background but I also chose someone who isn't super familiar with this topic. Both people were able to put everything together and form an opinion based on it. I was very satisfied with the feedback I received.

# Solution
For the solution I needed to put all of these together in a way that wasn't going to overwhelm the audience. Taking three simple visualozations and putting them together has the potential to be chaotic but with the colors I chose and the formats I picked for the numbers I believe the audience will have a relatively easy time putting everything together. With this visualization I was also aiming to inspire the audience to do self research and learn more about the story being told. I want the audience to ask why things are this way and why it is imporant. With this visualization I hope to accomplish that.
